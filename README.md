# Newsletter Signup Frontend
This is a simple (but meaningful) little project I built as part of my ongoing JavaScript learning journey. It's a newsletter signup frontend built with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it was a fun way for me to apply the skills I've been picking up along the way.

## 🛠 What It Does
-A clean, minimal signup form for a newsletter.
-Frontend validation (checks if the email entered is valid before allowing submission)
-If the email passes validation, the form switches to a success page/message to confirm the subscription.
-No frameworks, no libraries — just pure vanilla HTML/CSS/JS goodness.

## 🌱 Why I Built This
I’ve been diving deeper into JavaScript, and I really wanted to build something that felt complete, even if it’s small.

## I wanted to challenge myself to:
-Handle form validation manually (no shortcuts!)
-Manage DOM manipulation and conditional rendering in JavaScript
-Practice writing clean, readable code

## ✨ What I Learned
-How to properly validate an email input using regex (and not rage quit when it didn’t work at first)
-How to switch views with JS by hiding/showing elements, essentially simulating a “page switch” without reloading
-A better understanding of event listeners and keeping code organized
-That sometimes, the simplest projects are the best way to really understand what’s going on under the hood
